class BaseES(ABC):
    r"""Base class for all evolution strategies.

    .. note::

        The optimization is treated as minimization. e.g. maximize rewards is equivalent to minimize negative rewards.

    .. note::

        For painless parallelization, we highly recommend to use `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` with a few
        practical tips.

        * Set `max_workers` argument to control the max parallelization capacity.
        * When execution get stuck, try to use :class:`CloudpickleWrapper` to wrap the objective function
          e.g. particularly for lambda, class methods
        * Use `with ProcessPoolExecutor` once to wrap entire iterative ES generations. Because using this
          internally for each generation, it can slow down the parallelization dramatically due to overheads.
        * To reduce overheads further (e.g. PyTorch models, gym environments)
            * Recreate such models for each generation will be very expensive.
            * Use initializer function for ProcessPoolExecutor
            * Within initializer function, define PyTorch models and gym environments as global variables
              Note that the global variables are defined to each worker independently
            * Don't forget to use `with torch.no_grad` to increase forward pass speed.
